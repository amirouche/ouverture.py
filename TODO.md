# TODO

<!-- Format: bullet list with topic, type names, intended feature - one sentence max -->
<!-- Remove implemented entries in atomic commits (separate from feature commits) -->

- `run`: @lang should not be necessary when --debug flag is set
- `review`: make interactive, request explicit ack for security/correctness, one function at a time starting from lowest level, remember reviewed functions
- `commit`: add --parents flag to document parent implementations of the committed function
