**Beyond Babel, Python all around the world, one function at a time**

> ⚠️ **Experimental**: This is research software under active development.

> 🐮 **Curious?** Check out the [workflows](transcripts/_/) first, especially [La Langue du Feu](https://github.com/amirouche/bb.py/blob/main/transcripts/_/00-langue-du-feu.md) — a multilingual coding session that shows Beyond Babel in action.

Write functions in your language. Share logic universally. Beyond Babel creates bridges through shared logic—not by erasing differences, but by recognizing equivalence where it naturally emerges.

Beyond Babel is a function pool where the same code written in different human languages produces the same hash.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amirouche/bb.py
cd bb.py

# View examples
cat examples/example_simple.py          # English
cat examples/example_simple_french.py   # French
cat examples/example_simple_spanish.py  # Spanish

# Add a function to the pool
python3 bb.py add examples/example_simple.py@eng

# Get the hash (stored in $HOME/.local/bb/pool/ by default)
# Note: Use $BB_DIRECTORY to customize the location
find ~/.local/bb/pool -name "*.json"

# Retrieve in different language
python3 bb.py get <HASH>@fra
```

## Why "Beyond Babel"?

Beyond Babel refers to the Tower of Babel story - where humanity was divided by language barriers. Beyond Babel transcends those barriers, enabling code logic to flow seamlessly across human languages. Just as people once shared a common language, Beyond Babel code has no boundary between languages: the same logic flows seamlessly from French to English to Spanish and back.
