Tests for erdos_indices computation.

Tests the Erdős indices algorithm for generating minimal permutation sets
that cover all possible query patterns.

IMPORTANT: The length of erdos_indices(n) always equals the central binomial
coefficient C(n, n//2), which is the number of ways to choose n//2 items from n.
